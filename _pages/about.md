I am a Ph.D. student associated with the [Bio-Medical Informatics and Bio-Imaging Laboratory (Bio-MIBLab)](https://miblab.bme.gatech.edu/) at [Georgia Institute of Technology](https://www.gatech.edu/). Before my Ph.D., I earned my Bachelor‘s Degree from the [Air Force Institute of Technology](https://afit.edu.ng/home/), Nigeria. 

My research interests focus on the includes Bioinformatics, machine learning, generative AI, and signal & image analysis. My primary goal is to create novel intersection between deep learning, engineering, and analysis with broad applications to clinical decision support, with focus on classification trustworthiness.

with broad applications to clinical decision support, focusing on healthcare improvement
