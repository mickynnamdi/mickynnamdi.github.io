## Summary

The Heart Failure Prediction project aims to predict the likelihood of mortality of a patient considering various factors. The dataset used in the project contains 299 rows and 12 columns (features) which are the risk factors contributing to mortality. The project website was created as a final deliverable to the user. A machine learning prediction model can help with this, and hence immediate preventive measures can be taken to prevent a negative outcome. Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the number one cause of death globally, taking an estimated 17.9 million lives each year, which accounts for 31% of all deaths.


## Dataset
Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the number 1 cause of death globally, taking an estimated 17.9 million lives each year, which accounts for 31% of all deaths worlwide. Heart failure is a common event caused by CVDs and this dataset contains 12 features that can be used to predict mortality by heart failure.

Most cardiovascular diseases can be prevented by addressing behavioural risk factors such as tobacco use, unhealthy diet and obesity, physical inactivity and harmful use of alcohol using population-wide strategies.

People with cardiovascular disease or who are at high cardiovascular risk (due to the presence of one or more risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidaemia or already established disease) need early detection and management wherein a machine learning model can be of great help.

## Collaborators
This project is an open source project on Github under the Hamoye Data Science Internship that comprised of an eleven-man team of data scientists and data engineers alike. A Project Lead, Assistant Project Lead and a Query Analyst were selected to help coordinate the group. The workflow was evenly distributed among the team members, where each one was assigned a particular task, and his/ her performance was evaluated by the whole team.

In this project, each contributor is expected to make a pull request to the master branch, while the other team members would review and scrutinize the work. Regular meetings/interactions were held for better collaboration.
