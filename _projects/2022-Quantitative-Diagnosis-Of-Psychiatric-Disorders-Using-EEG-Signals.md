## Background
Mental disorders are a multifaceted issue with contributing factors such as brain development, environmental risks, and genetics. Twin studies suggest that genetics can track about 80 percent of the risk for schizophrenia and autism, and 75 percent of the risk for bipolar disorder. The contribution of these factors can be assessed through EEG, a test that detects abnormalities in brain waves.

## Objective
The objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately diagnose psychiatric disorders using EEG signals. The model is trained on a dataset of EEG signals collected from patients with various psychiatric disorders.

## Methodology
The project uses a variety of machine learning algorithms, including logistic regression, decision trees, and support vector machines, to classify EEG signals into different psychiatric disorders. The performance of each algorithm is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

## Results
The results show that the machine learning model can accurately diagnose psychiatric disorders using EEG signals. The best performing algorithm is the support vector machine, which achieves an accuracy of 80% on the test set.

## Conclusion
The project demonstrates the potential of using EEG signals for the quantitative diagnosis of psychiatric disorders. The machine learning model developed in this project can be used as a tool to assist clinicians in the diagnosis of psychiatric disorders.
